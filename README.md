# stop-fake-discord-friends

## Why?

I am friends with over 1000 users on Discord and I need to filter out the "fake" friends, the people I have never talked to.

## Run it

* fill `.env` file

* run `create-files.js`
* run `fill-friends-file.js`
* run `eris-export.js`
* run `fill-friends-channels-file.js`
* run `check-fake-friends.js`

fake friends will appear in `data/fake-friends.txt`.
